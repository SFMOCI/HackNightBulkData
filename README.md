###San Francisco City and Administrative Codes 
In this repository, you will find RTF and TXT files of the City Codes for San Francisco for use at the Open Legislation Civic Hack Night on August 7, 2013.

###What this Data includes:
* "Snapshots" of the most up to date version of the Administrative Code, with S44 being the most recent, and the 9 previous versions of the code indicated by S43-S36 labels.
* The current versions of health/building/fire/safety/zoning codes for the city of San Francisco.
* The most current version of the code is always available at the [American Legal Publishing website] (http://www.amlegal.com/library/ca/sfrancisco.shtml).  

###Introduction
The Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation is interested in making an up-to-date, technologist-friendly version of San Francisco Administrative Code and similar legislative resources available through the DataSF portal in machine readable formats.  We are working with American Legal, the current publisher, to automate the process by the complete code is pulled to our data portal, and with the Open Government Foundation to subsequently convert this bulk data into a format like XML or JSON.  GitHub, Code for America, and sf.citi have already expressed interest in collaborating with SF MOCI on this project, and we envision that the impact of “open legislation” could be analogous to our office’s previous successes around open data.

###Anticipated Results
While we do not know what specific uses or applications will be generated as a result of this effort, we anticipate the emergent technologies will increase overall accessibility of the administrative code and uncover new insights for the city. Examples include visualizations of changes of the legal code over time, identification of arcane legislation that needs revision, identification of what the “hot” areas of legislative code (those that undergo constant revision ) are, etc.  Further downstream, it will be worthwhile to begin working with city planners and legislators to see what products they would like to be developed from the Open Legislation.
